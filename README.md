Student developer exploring systems programming and low-level architecture.

Since April 2024, I’ve been studying C, Rust, and Assembly with a focus on understanding how software interacts with memory and hardware.

My background in digital electronics shapes how I think about execution models, data layout, and ownership — I’m interested in how systems work beneath abstractions, not just how to use them.

Currently building foundations in memory management, invariants, and performance-aware design.

## ⚙️ Core Languages

C — fundamentals of manual memory management

Rust — ownership model and safety guarantees

Assembly — basic execution flow and hardware interaction

## 🧠 Current Focus

Understanding memory layout and stack/heap behavior

Modeling ownership and lifetimes

Writing simple performance-aware code

Studying systems-level design principles

## 🧩 Interests

Strong type systems

Cache-aware thinking

Minimalist, explicit software design

Compiler and low-level tooling concepts
